I'm a French senior developer, CTO at [Adagio](https://adagio.io), <span title="and Président">former CTO</span> at [WebPerf IO](https://webperf.io), and former CTO at [Silentale](http://silentale.com).

## Experience

I'm building the [Adagio](https://adagio.io/) advertising optimization platform.

As a co-founder and CTO, I built and operated the [WebPerf IO](https://webperf.io/) analytics platform, measuring billions of web performance events per month. It's used by major French media and e-commerce websites, like [Le Figaro](https://www.lefigaro.fr), [L'Express](https://www.lexpress.fr), [Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr), [L'Équipe](https://www.lequipe.fr/), or [PriceMinister](https://priceminister.com).

I built the former [Silentale](http://silentale.com) platform, providing painless archiving and search of social and email conversations, used by tens of thousands of people around the globe.

Before that, I worked [at](https://atos.net) [various](https://www.opentext.com/) [companies](https://www.michelin.com/) in France and Canada after graduating from the [Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers](https://www.cnam.fr/).

## Open source

A [few rubygems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/nfo).

## Talks

I did a talk for [MongoFR 2011](https://www.slideshare.net/nfo/mongo-a-la-resque) in Paris, and a few other ones during various events at [La Cantine](https://paris.numa.co/) between 2009 and 2011.
