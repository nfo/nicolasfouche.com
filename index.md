## Experience

I'm building the [Adagio](https://adagio.io/) advertising optimization platform, used by European media websites.

As a co-founder and CTO, I built and operated the [WebPerf IO](https://webperf.io/) analytics platform, measuring billions of web performance events per month. It's used by major French media and e-commerce websites, like [Le Figaro](https://www.lefigaro.fr), [L'Express](https://www.lexpress.fr), [Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr), [L'Équipe](https://www.lequipe.fr/), or [PriceMinister](https://priceminister.com).

I built the former [Silentale](http://silentale.com) platform, providing painless archiving and search of social and email conversations, used by tens of thousands of people around the globe.

Before that, I worked [at](https://atos.net) [various](https://www.opentext.com/) [companies](https://www.michelin.com/) in France and Canada after graduating from the [Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers](https://the.cnam.eu/).

## Skills

Ouch. Too long to list after 15 years working on so many projects.

These days, I build scalable and resilient stream processing platforms with Kafka Streams, Apache Spark and Google Cloud products, with data stored in Aerospike, MemSQL, Cassandra, Kafka, and MongoDB. I design, code, deploy and operate these platforms on bare-metal, Scalway, AWS and Azure.

Some of these platforms provide machine learning features, powered by H2O or Tensorflow.

I am also the author of several web applications powered by Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Lua/OpenResty backend, all served by nginx. On the frontend side, they use plain JS, React or AngularJS.

I also know a *few things* about web performance, web security, the DevOps culture, search engines, code quality and efficiency, and coding on electronic boards.

My [open-source libraries](https://rubygems.org/profiles/nfo) were downloaded more than 750,000 times.

## Talks

I did a talk for [MongoFR 2011](https://www.slideshare.net/nfo/mongo-a-la-resque) in Paris, and a few other ones during various events at [La Cantine](https://paris.numa.co/) between 2009 and 2011.
