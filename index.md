I'm a developer, startup advisor and seed investor living in the south of France.


I'm currently available for hire. If you're interested in some help on your product, send me an <a href="mailto:nicolas.fouche@gmail.com">email</a> and we'll chat. If you want referrals I'd be happy to shoot you some people to contact.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nfo), [GitHub](http://github.com/nfo), and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasfouche).

## Experience

As a freelance, I'm helping building the [Onfocus](http://onfocus.io/) analytics platform, already used by major European media websites.

As a co-founder and CTO, I built and still operate the [WebPerf IO](http://webperf.io/) analytics platform. It's used by [major](http://www.lefigaro.fr) [French](http://www.lexpress.fr) [media](http://www.leparisien.fr) [and](http://www.lequipe.fr/) [ecommerce](http://priceminister.com) [websites](http://www.clubic.com/).

I built the former [Silentale](http://silentale.com) platform, providing painless archiving and search of social and email conversations, used by tens of thousands of people around the globe.

Before that, I worked [at](http://atos.net) [various](http://www.opentext.com/) [companies](http://www.michelin.com/) in France and Canada after graduating from the [Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers](http://the.cnam.eu/).

## Skills

Ouch. Too long to list after 15 years working on so many projects.

These days, I build stream processing platforms with Apache Spark, Apache Samza and/or custom components in Lua, Node.js or Go, storing their data in Aerospike, MemSQL, Cassandra, Kafka, and MongoDB. I design, code, deploy and operate these platforms on bare-metal, AWS or Azure.

I am the author of a few web applications powered by Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Lua/OpenResty, all served by nginx.

I know a *few things* about web performance, web security, search engines, coding on electronic boards.

## Open-Source Projects

Sadly, most of my work is closed-source, except a few libraries and tools listed below.

### gmail_xoauth

The Ruby library [gmail_xoauth](https://github.com/nfo/gmail_xoauth) provides passwordless access to Gmail, via the OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0a protocols. It adds the `XOAUTH2` and `XOAUTH` custom authenticators to the standard IMAP and SMTP libraries.

### ZenPush

The Ruby command-line tool [ZenPush](https://github.com/cleverscale/zenpush) allows editing your Zendesk knowledge base in Markdown, while keeping a copy of all your articles in your own code repository.

## Talks

I did a talk for [MongoFR 2011](http://lanyrd.com/2011/mongofr/speakers/) in Paris, and a few other ones during various events at [La Cantine](https://paris.numa.co/) between 2009 and 2011.
